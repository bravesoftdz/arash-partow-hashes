# Change log

## v1.1.0 - 2022-01-14

* Modified all `string` types to `AnsiString` to make that type explicit (since `string` type changed from `AnsiString` to `UnicodeString` at Delphi 2009).
* Modified `LICENSE.md` to include new contributor.

## v1.0.0 - 2022-01-14

Original code from 2002 by Arash Partow.

This release comprises the original 2002 code along with new read-me, license and changelog files.

> **Note:** This version assumes `string = AnsiString` and is therefore only suitable for use with versions of Delphi prior to Delphi 2009.
